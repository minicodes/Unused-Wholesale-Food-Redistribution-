# Unused-Wholesale-Food-Redistribution-
In the times of COVID19, a platform to redistribute food that was originally slated for hotels, cruise lines, airlines and schools is now open for purchase/donation to retailers, individuals, businesses and charities.


Inspiration: As more and more people grapple with the scarcity of supermarket goods, there are a lot of wholesale food sellers that have not been able to sell their food that would normally cater to hotels, airlines, high end restaurants across the world. The sales from these wholesales has dropped as much as 70%.

In order to avoid waste and to get the word out to people in need, small businesses that are struggling to find food and charities my project consists of the following:

Create a universal platform that will allow wholesales to sign up to sell their goods and connect them with potential customers. The sign up web page will request the following information:

company *products/goods *location *price
optional: send food to charity
On the other end, individuals, businesses and/or charities will be able to sign up on a web based sign up page. They will provide the following information: *name *individual/business/non-profit *location

Platforms for payment and delivery would be included to complete the logistic chain.

The platform will connect wholesalers and individuals/ businesses/charities to redistribute unsold food in an efficient way, which is a problem on both ends.
